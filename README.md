## Why did I choose this topic for the project?
With the development of technology and solving many problems more easily by computers and computer networks, the Internet has become very popular among people. People do many things like buying and selling commodity  online.<br>
Internet marketing helps sellers to grow their business and also helps buyers to have a safer, more economical and faster purchase. People use the internet to find different information. They are constantly searching to find information about the businesses, products and services they are interested in.<br>
Sellers also tend to get information about customers, including where they live, where they work, and where they want to shop, in order to make more profit. All these things and even more information than these things are gathered in this environment: the Internet.<br>
Online internet marketing is very valuable for people's businesses because it helps them connect with potential customers who are interested in their business.<br>
In traditional advertising, communication has been one-way. Sellers place a television ad or a print ad in a newspaper and wait for their target audience to see their ad and refer to their business.<br>
So, what happens if their audience has questions or doubts about this business and how to meet their needs? What if these people want to learn more about your business, product or service? This is difficult and costly when the conversation is not two-way. The importance of Internet marketing lies in the ability to create two-way communication.<br>
In internet marketing, sellers give customers a way to contact their business; Whenever they create a post on social media, they are actually creating an opportunity for people to interact with their business. For this reason, Internet marketing can be considered a favorable method for both buyers and sellers, which provides their interests much better than traditional methods.<br>
Therefore, in this project, the design of the website of the online store, which is considered one of the main titles of internet marketing, has been discussed.
